## **_Description_**

This app allows users to create parties and comments as well. Users are able to see the parties that are on the list as soon as they arrive to the page. Once they have registered and logged in, they are able to create their own parties and comment on other parties. They can update and delete the comments they make on parties. 

## **_How to Get Started_**

A user can peruse parties and their comments without being logged in. Once logged in, a user can create, update and delete comments.
